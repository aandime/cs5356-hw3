                <p>
                    Tiger is a British Shorthair which is one of the oldest and most beloved cat breeds, known for its plush, dense coat, round face, and large, expressive eyes. While the most iconic British Shorthair is the classic blue/gray coat, they come in various colors, including the stunning golden-blue variation that Tiger has himself. 
                    It gives him a shimmering appearance!
                    These cats are affectionate and can be independent which makes them perfect companions for those who appreciate a low-maintenance yet loving pet. British Shorthairs are known for their calm demeanor, intelligence, and adaptability, making them great for anyone who loves cats or is thinking of owning a cat.
                    Their thick coat does require regular brushing to maintain its softness and shine so lots of brushing would be needed.
                    With their plush, teddy bear-like looks and laid-back personality, British Shorthairs are a true blend of elegance and warmth, making them an ideal cat friend!
